        <article>
          <p>The first modern incubator was invented  by Dr. Alexander Lyon in 1891 around 30 years prior to the Pan-American Exposition. The first American incubator hospital was set up at the trans-Mississippi exposition in Omaha, Nebraska but were still not widely used by the medical community in hospitals or clinics. It was recognized that the survival of prematurely born infants of around 7 months' gestation depended on keeping the infant uniformly warm, feeding it frequently, and keeping it free of disease. This was the goal of the designers of infant incubator.</p>
          <p>The Infant Incubator was a demonstration of the most modern way of caring for premature infants </p>

        <header>What is infant incubator</header>
        <article>
          <p>Infant incubator is a medical device which provides warmth, humidity, and oxygen all in a controlled environment as required by new born, it has an isolation chamber that helps to regulate the temperature of an infant and this equipment can provide air which is enriched in humidity or oxygen. This equipment provides a warm, moist and sometimes sterile environment for the new-born. The basic machine has a place for the baby to lie and it is surrounded by a clear plastic box . A heating element lies bellow the baby there is always a control for the heater and generally a feedback mechanism of regulate temperature within a degree set point. Most incubators in developing word have latex gloves built into chamber that allow for manipulation of the body without entering the isolated environment </p>

        <article>
        <p>Infant incubator is used to provide a clean environment and helps to protect the baby from noise, dust, infections and excess handling.this machine provides a warm , moist and sometimes a sterile environment  for a new-born.</p>

            <p>Since the baby lies in a closed hood it is difficult to access the baby for medical procedure or care</p>

        <header>Mode Of Operation</header>
        <article>
            <p> Infant incubator provides a closed, controlled environment that warms an infant by circulating heated air over the skin and the heat is the  absorbed into the body by tissue conduction and blood convention. A temperature sensor is taped to the baby’s skin and the incubator heater adjust to maintain the baby at a constant temperature or it is controlled by thermostat in the heated airstream. Underneath the baby is an-blown electric heating system and humidification system which circulates heated humid air at a desired temperature and humidity through the incubator chamber.  Temperature is displayed via panel displays , digitally in newer units, with analogy meter in older units and with a thermometer in the oldest units. 
                Most units have a small fan to move air past the heater and into the infant incubator. The oldest of the units have alarm sittings for over and under temperatures in the incubator. There also is a default high temperature cut-off that prevents the incubator from heating above 40 degrees c .
                In some unit there is a reservoir of water that the air moves to increase the humidity in the infant chamber. To reduce the water loss any effort model to reduces water loss of infant in an incubator the relative humidity in the incubator should be between 60and 90%. All the access doors should have positive latches on them so that they stay closed . the hoods have one or more cables or tubing entry ports that allow for monitoring cables, IV lines , suction tubing  to enter the infant camber without going through an access door.</p>

        <header>Maintainance and Safety</header>
        <article>
    <p>Here are the various things u need to do for maintainace and safety precousions </p>
    <li>The humidification chamber should be rinsed out and dried after every use and it is acceptable to use diluted bleach to cleanse the chamber.</li>
    <li>If the heat control is rheostat, the knob should be checked to make sure that is not loose and turning on shaft.</li>
    <li>For safety, if the temperature is not maintained in the  chamber, there may be a large leak or opening , the seals around the doors has to be checked and the external source ,sunlight or phototherapy lights . they can affect warming characteristics of the incubator</li>
    <li>The path of the movement of the air must be kept clear to ensure that the temperature is stable and even across the infant in all positions.</li>
    <li>If phototherapy is used in conjunction with infant incubator there will be risk of elevated temperature therefore it is advised to check the temperature periodically.</li>

        <header>Common Problems</header>
        <article>
    <p>Here are the different common problems:</p>
    <li>Chamber not heating: this may be the heating element  and since it’s a wire it cannot be repaired  but it can be replaced  and the only requirement for replacing heating element wire with a new one are that the power and resistance of the new element be equals to the power and resistance of the old one.</li>
    <li>Particles can build up inside the humidification chamber</li>
    <li>Dropping of air flow: this is mostly due to the fan filter, the frequency of replacement</li>
    <li>In some units there is an inner wall in the infant chamber  that directs the flow of the heated air around the infant. These inner walls are held in place with plastic standoff posts and may loosen up with use therefore they should be inspected to assure that they are properly fastened in place.</li>
    <li>Other problems are linked to the thermostat failure that causes incubator to overheat, infant hyperthermia, and to malfunctions or design deflect that produces fire and electrical shock hazards</li>

        <header>Troubleshouting Methods</header>
        <article>
          <p> Troubleshouting and repair procedures:</p>
      <li>A dead spot in the rheostat may cause it to change the temperature with only small change in position ,  the dust on the rheostat should be cleaned out and if it doesn’t work then the rheostat will have to be replaced.</li>
      <li>The temperature should function between 34°and 40° ,and should be accurate to within 0.5° at all possible settings.</li>
      <li>If the fan produces noise , lubrication of the motor and tightening loose bolts is needed.</li>
    ers (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
